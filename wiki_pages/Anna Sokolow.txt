Anna Sokolow (February 9, 1910, Hartford, Connecticut – March 29, 2000, Manhattan, New York City) was an American dancer and choreographer known for the social justice focus and theatricality of her work, and for her support of the development of Modern Dance in Mexico and in Israel. At the beginning of her career, Anna Sokolow was a principal dancer in the Martha Graham Company (1930-1938) and she soon became an independent choreographer who went on to form multiple dance companies throughout her life beginning with “Dance Unit” in the 1930s and later The Player's Project which launched in 1971 and re-launched in the 1980s. Sokolow choreographed for and set her work on companies around the world, including major companies such as Batsheva Dance Company, Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, The Jose Limón Dance Company, Joffery Ballet and the Daniel Lewis Dance Company. Her work continues to be performed by the Sokolow Theatre/Dance Ensemble in New York City. Her work is preserved and set by the Sokolow Theatre/Dance Ensemble and the Sokolow Dance Foundation in Massachusetts.
